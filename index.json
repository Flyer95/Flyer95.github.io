Even now I am still tweaking and modifying the visual style to make something that\u0026rsquo;s unique while also looks good but I\u0026rsquo;ve made a bunch of progress since I started on this project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, here is a super early version of what Project Yukon first looked like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/ruins.gif\" alt=\"A gif of Juniper sitting on a piece of temple ruins next to a river.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, the colors look very desaturated and bland, expecially compared to the trunks and leaves of the trees around them. And while winter isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly full of light and color, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want the world to feel too flat and lifeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see that I had decided early on that I wanted the visual design to be stylized and simple. Unreal Engine is great for making realistic games, especially when using Lumen, Nanite, and the Quixel Megascans that come with UE5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, since I\u0026rsquo;m working on this game on my own, any asset I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a realistic model or texture for would have to be modeled and textured by myself. There\u0026rsquo;s also the fact that the realistic route would also mean that animations for Carter, Juniper, and everything else in the world would also have to be animated more realistically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong story short, a realistic style was off the table so I needed to figure out an art style to utilize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"creative-parameters\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Creative Parameters\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my favorite lessons that I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in game development but also creativity in general: Seeing a \u0026ldquo;Limitation\u0026rdquo; instead as a \u0026ldquo;Creative Parameter\u0026rdquo;. I remember hearing about the implimentation of the fog in Silent Hill and how it was added primarily due to the original Playstation not being able to have that high of a render distance. The fog was able to not only hide the pop-in of assets but also added to the unsettling atmosphere of the game. For example, now players would hear monsters before they would become visable through the fog, giving them a few moments of fear and unease as they tried to figure out where the creature would be coming from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also used this outside of game development when writing music. Sometimes I will give myself artificial limitations to help break out of whatever creative block I\u0026rsquo;m in or write something in a way I normally wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. In making the soundtrack for the game jam project \u003ca href=\"/gamepages/mememessenger\"\u003eMeme Messenger\u003c/a\u003e, I made sure to fit ringtones samples into each of the trackss in order for them to better fit with the smartphone/texting nature of the game. The samples ended up making each of the songs sound unique and were incredible inspiration in making the tracks for the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"inspirations\"\u003eInspirations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComics and manga were and still are the main sources of inspiration for Yukon\u0026rsquo;s visual style. I really like the vibrant colors with relatively simply shading, as well as the creative means that shadows can be conveyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also fit my needs and matched the tone of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRelatively easy to model and texture, given my beginner experiance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFits the generally pulp-y adventure stories that inspired the game.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a unique design that stands out in a crowd.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also came across the work of Caspar David Friedrich, a 19th-century German that made a lot of paintings depicting humans in expansive landscapes. A few of his paintings fit the feeling that I wanted Project Yukon to have, at least occationally. This is a black and white photograph of \u0026ldquo;Monk in the Snow\u0026rdquo; from 1808, the original painting having been destroyed in a fire. The original work might have had more color to it, but I liked how desolate it made the location feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/monkinthesnow.png\" alt=\"Caspar David Friedrich\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Monk in the Snow\u0026rdquo;\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;ve played Minecraft, you might also recognize another painting of his, \u0026ldquo;Wanderer above the Sea of Fog\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the paintings you can place in the game, which I thought was a cool discovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"iterative-implimentation\"\u003eIterative Implimentation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh boy, if I were to go through all the iterations of the post process shader we could be here all day. And I\u0026rsquo;ve already kept you here a while so I\u0026rsquo;ll try and be quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"cel-shading\"\u003eCel-Shading\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCel-shading was the first thing I worked on, going through at least three different methods before settling on the one I am currently using (I really want to go back in and tweak it still so maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get to four, who knows).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shading was implimented, I experimented with having a different number of color bands. Here\u0026rsquo;s an image from May 2023 showing some of these changes and experiments. In Version 1, there were only 2 bands, meaning there was a \u0026ldquo;lit\u0026rdquo; color and an \u0026ldquo;unlit\u0026rdquo; color. Version 2 instead has two in-between colors for edges of the light. So instead of just a \u0026ldquo;lit\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;unlit\u0026rdquo; color, there are also \u0026ldquo;partially lit\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;mostly lit\u0026rdquo; colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/celshadeversions.png\" alt=\"Versions 2 and 1 of the cel-shader on a ruins mockup ingame\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe resulting image was a lot darker than I liked but it did make the normal maps stand out less, which you can see in the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"outlines\"\u003eOutlines\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutlines were something I wanted to add in order to break up the\u0026hellip; well, outlines\u0026hellip; of the objects in the world. This isn\u0026rsquo;t too difficult to do in Unreal and game engines, but I wanted to make sure that outlines could also be applied to the normal textures of an object to add more variety and make the normal maps stand out more. Here\u0026rsquo;s a comparrison between two versions of the outline implimentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/outlinecomparrison.png\" alt=\"Versions 1 and 2 of the outline shading on a ruins mockup ingame\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can probably see how Version 2 stone walls and rock look way too grainy and detailed, although the grass surrounding the ruins is more clear in how it\u0026rsquo;s seperated and the overall outlines on everything are more subtle. You can also tell that in both versions the outlines of the trees looks really notiable and add a lot of black to their design. This is something that was fixed later on with using a new tree model, which was useful to learn. A post processing shader can be implimented and coded perfectly but a bad model can make it look muddy and off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"crosshatching\"\u003eCrosshatching\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrosshatching was something I expected to be a lot harder than it actually was. In a lot of ways, it\u0026rsquo;s basically a slightly different kind of cel-shading, just adding an additional texture instead of changing the color depending on the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s the first implimentation of it in September of 2023.\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/hatching.png\" alt=\"Project Yukon hatching demonstation\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI initially loved how subtle it looked but it came to be a bit of an issue later on. The hatching is on a pixel level in this image, which meant that there would be a lot of ghosting whenever the player passed over them with their outline. Currently, I\u0026rsquo;ve removed the hatching entirely but I still want to try and figure out a way to make it work without muddying the image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, so this is roughly where the game currently stands in terms of its visual style. The cel-shading is limited to only 2 bands (although there seems to be some weird errors with this I need to work on), outlines are subtle but still present, and the overall color scheme is bright and vibrant, although the tall grass should probably look less like a wheat field and more dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/currentstyle.png\" alt=\"Project Yukon\u0026rsquo;s most recent stylied post process shader demonstration\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may also notice that the trees in the back have no outline. This is to prevent the outline standing out to the point of overwhelming the tree silhouette as the camera moves away from it. I think it stands out a little too much here but I\u0026rsquo;ll work on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, maybe adding some fog will help.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/projects/currentstyle.png","permalink":"https://flyer95.github.io/posts/lookandfeel/","title":"Project Yukon: Developing a Style"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"a-new-beginning\"\u003eA New Beginning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, I started posting \u0026ldquo;devlog-like\u0026rdquo; posts on a Discord server for the game. However, as time has gone on, leaving all of my development logs and messages on a single platform I don\u0026rsquo;t have complete control over hasn\u0026rsquo;t seemed like a good idea. I would hate for all the development notes and such to be locked on Discord or worse be lost if the server or Discord itself goes away. Going forward, everything Project Yukon related on the game will be stored here. Other kinds of posts (YouTube videos and stuff hosted on other sites) will have their own posts here so everything can be found in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese first few posts will be re-posts of the Discord stuff with better focus and more depth and more space than Discord would allow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about Project Yukon\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-project-yukon\"\u003eWhat is Project Yukon?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProject Yukon\u003c/strong\u003e is a third-person adventure that follows Carter, a young archieologist trying to unravel the mysteries surrounding an abandoned ancient civilization with help from an oddly curious fox. The mechanics involve the player and the, who Carter names Juniper, working together to solve puzzles and traverse the world. This unique mechanic allows for equally unique puzzle design and choices the player can make in relation to Juniper\u0026rsquo;s actions. It also doubles as a way to have the player (and carter) to bond with their companion as the game unfolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter 4 years of off-and-on work, I have a completed prototype and a clearer vision for the gameplay loop, story, and narrative for the game. That might sound like a long time and it is, but I think the Project Yukon that\u0026rsquo;s in development now wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be what it is without those 4 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m excited to continue to work on it and get more work done on it. And I hope you\u0026rsquo;re excited to follow along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":"/images/projects/yukon_lake.png","permalink":"https://flyer95.github.io/posts/mypost/","title":"Project Yukon: Overview"}]
